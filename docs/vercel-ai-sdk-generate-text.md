Title: generateText

URL Source: https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text

Markdown Content:
Generates text and calls tools for a given prompt using a language model.

It is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.

```
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';import { generateText } from 'ai';const { text } = await generateText({  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',});console.log(text);
```

The language model to use. Example: openai('gpt-4-turbo')

The system prompt to use that specifies the behavior of the model.

The input prompt to generate the text from.

### messages:

A list of messages that represent a conversation. Automatically converts UI messages from the useChat hook.

CoreSystemMessage

CoreUserMessage

The role for the user message.

### content:

string | Array<TextPart | ImagePart | FilePart\>

The content of the message.

TextPart

The type of the message part.

The text content of the message part.

ImagePart

The type of the message part.

### image:

string | Uint8Array | Buffer | ArrayBuffer | URL

The image content of the message part. String are either base64 encoded content, base64 data URLs, or http(s) URLs.

The mime type of the image. Optional.

FilePart

The type of the message part.

### data:

string | Uint8Array | Buffer | ArrayBuffer | URL

The file content of the message part. String are either base64 encoded content, base64 data URLs, or http(s) URLs.

The mime type of the file.

CoreAssistantMessage

The role for the assistant message.

### content:

string | Array<TextPart | ToolCallPart\>

The content of the message.

TextPart

The type of the message part.

The text content of the message part.

ToolCallPart

The type of the message part.

The name of the tool, which typically would be the name of the function.

### args:

object based on zod schema

Parameters generated by the model to be used by the tool.

CoreToolMessage

### content:

Array<ToolResultPart\>

The content of the message.

ToolResultPart

The type of the message part.

The id of the tool call the result corresponds to.

The name of the tool the result corresponds to.

The result returned by the tool after execution.

Whether the result is an error or an error message.

Maximum number of tokens to generate.

Temperature setting. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. It is recommended to set either \`temperature\` or \`topP\`, but not both.

Nucleus sampling. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. It is recommended to set either \`temperature\` or \`topP\`, but not both.

Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token. Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use temperature.

Presence penalty setting. It affects the likelihood of the model to repeat information that is already in the prompt. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.

Frequency penalty setting. It affects the likelihood of the model to repeatedly use the same words or phrases. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.

Sequences that will stop the generation of the text. If the model generates any of these sequences, it will stop generating further text.

The seed (integer) to use for random sampling. If set and supported by the model, calls will generate deterministic results.

Maximum number of retries. Set to 0 to disable retries. Default: 2.

An optional abort signal that can be used to cancel the call.

Maximum number of sequential LLM calls (steps), e.g. when you use tool calls. A maximum number is required to prevent infinite loops in the case of misconfigured tools. By default, it is set to 1.

### experimental_generateMessageId?:

() =\> string

Function used to generate a unique ID for each message. This is an experimental feature.

### experimental_continueSteps?:

boolean

Enable or disable continue steps. Disabled by default.

### experimental_telemetry?:

TelemetrySettings

Telemetry configuration. Experimental feature.

TelemetrySettings

Enable or disable telemetry. Disabled by default while experimental.

Enable or disable input recording. Enabled by default.

Enable or disable output recording. Enabled by default.

Identifier for this function. Used to group telemetry data by function.

### experimental_output?:

Output

Experimental setting for generating structured outputs.

Output

Generate a JSON object of type OBJECT.

Options

The schema of the JSON object to generate.

### onStepFinish?:

(result: onStepFinishResult) =\> Promise<void\> | void

Callback that is called when a step is finished.

onStepFinishResult

### stepType:

"initial" | "continue" | "tool-result"

The type of step. The first step is always an "initial" step, and subsequent steps are either "continue" steps or "tool-result" steps.

### finishReason:

"stop" | "length" | "content-filter" | "tool-calls" | "error" | "other" | "unknown"

The reason the model finished generating the text for the step.

The token usage of the step.

TokenUsage

The total number of tokens in the prompt.

The total number of tokens in the completion.

The total number of tokens generated.

The full text that has been generated.

### warnings:

Warning\[\] | undefined

Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).

Response metadata.

Response

The response identifier. The AI SDK uses the ID from the provider response when available, and generates an ID otherwise.

The model that was used to generate the response. The AI SDK uses the response model from the provider response when available, and the model from the function call otherwise.

The timestamp of the response. The AI SDK uses the response timestamp from the provider response when available, and creates a timestamp otherwise.

True when there will be a continuation step with a continuation text.

The generated text by the model.

### finishReason:

'stop' | 'length' | 'content-filter' | 'tool-calls' | 'error' | 'other' | 'unknown'

The reason the model finished generating the text.

### usage:

Raw request HTTP body that was sent to the provider API as a string (JSON should be stringified).

### response?:

ResponseMetadata

Response metadata.

### warnings:

Warning\[\] | undefined

Warnings from the model provider (e.g. unsupported settings).

### experimental_output?:

Output

Experimental setting for generating structured outputs.
